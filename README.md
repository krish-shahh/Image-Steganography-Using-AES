# Image-Steganography-Using-AES

<p>Today almost all digital services like internet communication, medical and military imaging systems, multimedia system requires reliable security in storage and transmission of digital images. Due to faster growth in multimedia technology, internet and cell phones, there is a need for security in digital images. Therefore there is a need for image encryption techniques in order to hide images from such attacks. In this system we use AES (Advanced Encryption Technique) in order to hide image. Such Encryption technique helps to avoid intrusion attacks.</p>
